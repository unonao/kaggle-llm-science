Also p. 134: [On CRs] \"Using Celtic symbols such as triskeles and spirals\" Other uses of triskelion-like emblems include the logo for the Trisquel Linux distribution and the seal of the United States Department of Transportation. The triskelion was a motif in the art of the Iron age Celtic La Tène culture. ===Classical Antiquity=== The triskeles proper, composed of three human legs, is younger than the triple spiral, found in decorations on Greek pottery especially as a design shown on hoplite shields, and later also minted on Greek and Anatolian coinage.

The symbol appears in the island's official flag and official coat of arms, as well as its currency. The spiral triskele is one of the primary symbols of Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism, used to represent a variety of triplicities in cosmology and theology; it is also a favored symbol due to its association with the god Manannán mac Lir.Bonewits, Isaac (2006) Bonewits's Essential Guide to Druidism. The three legs (triskeles) symbol is rarely found as a charge in late medieval heraldry, notably as the arms of the King of Mann (Armorial Wijnbergen, ), and as canting arms in the city seal of the Bavarian city of Füssen (dated 1317). ==Modern usage== The triskeles was included in the design of the Army Gold Medal awarded to British Army majors and above who had taken a key part in the Battle of Maida (1806).Charles Norton Elvin, A Dictionary of Heraldry (1889), p. 126. The independentist Massimo Cirano, belonging to the \"Archimedes Section\" of the MIS presented himself in April 2019, with his symbol and list, to the administrative authorities of the municipality of Bagheria obtaining 1160 votes == Symbols == * The Sicilian Independence Movement had the Trinacria as its symbol. It later appears in heraldry, and, other than in the flag of Sicily, came to be used in the flag of the Isle of Man (known as ny tree cassyn \"the three legs\").Adopted in 1932, the flag of the Isle of Man is derived from the arms of the King of Mann recorded in the 13th century. thumb|Neolithic triple spiral symbol A triskelion or triskeles is an ancient motif consisting of a triple spiral exhibiting rotational symmetry or other patterns in triplicate that emanate from a common center. Later versions of Sicilian flags have retained the emblem, including the one officially adopted in 2000. Greek (triskelḗs) means \"three-legged\".τρισκελής, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library; from τρι- (tri-), \"three times\" (τρι- , Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library) and \"σκέλος\" (skelos), \"leg (σκέλος, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek–English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library) While the Greek adjective \"three-legged [e.g. of a table]\" is ancient, use of the term for the symbol is modern, introduced in 1835 by Honoré Théodoric d'Albert de Luynes as French ,Honore-Theodoric-Paul-Joseph d'Albert de Luynes, Etudes numismatiques sur quelques types relatifs au culte d'Hecate (1835), 83f. and adopted in the spelling triskeles following Otto Olshausen (1886).Johannes Maringer, \"Das Triskeles in der vor- und frühgeschichtlichen Kunst\", Anthropos 74.3/4 (1979), pp. 566-576 The form triskelion (as it were Greek Classical Greek does not have , but the form \"small tripod\" is on record as the diminutive of \"three-pronged\". In Ireland before the 5th century, in Celtic Christianity the symbol took on new meaning, as a symbol of the Trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit). ==Medieval use== The triple spiral design is found as a decorative element in Gothic architecture. \n",

The opposite change, a decrease in wavelength and simultaneous increase in frequency and energy, is known as a negative redshift, or blueshift.

Other physical processes exist that can lead to a shift in the frequency of electromagnetic radiation, including scattering and optical effects; however, the resulting changes are distinguishable from (astronomical) redshift and are not generally referred to as such (see section on physical optics and radiative transfer). ==History== The history of the subject began with the development in the 19th century of classical wave mechanics and the exploration of phenomena associated with the Doppler effect. Redshift (and blueshift) may be characterized by the relative difference between the observed and emitted wavelengths (or frequency) of an object. The blue shift can be observed when internal energy of the matter is transferred to the photon; this process is called anti-Stokes Raman scattering. In such cases, the shifts correspond to a physical energy transfer to matter or other photons rather than being by a transformation between reference frames. Examples of strong redshifting are a gamma ray perceived as an X-ray, or initially visible light perceived as radio waves. This is known as the gravitational redshift or Einstein Shift. Conversely, Doppler effect redshifts () are associated with objects receding (moving away) from the observer with the light shifting to lower energies. In visible light, this shifts a color towards the blue end of the spectrum. === Doppler blueshift === thumb|Doppler redshift and blueshift Doppler blueshift is caused by movement of a source towards the observer. In this scattering process, the incident photon interacts with matter (gas, liquid, and solid) and the frequency of the photon is shifted towards red or blue. In interstellar astronomy, visible spectra can appear redder due to scattering processes in a phenomenon referred to as interstellar reddening—similarly Rayleigh scattering causes the atmospheric reddening of the Sun seen in the sunrise or sunset and causes the rest of the sky to have a blue color. The term applies to any decrease in wavelength and increase in frequency caused by relative motion, even outside the visible spectrum. Likewise, gravitational blueshifts are associated with light emitted from a source residing within a weaker gravitational field as observed from within a stronger gravitational field, while gravitational redshifting implies the opposite conditions. == Redshift formulae == In general relativity one can derive several important special-case formulae for redshift in certain special spacetime geometries, as summarized in the following table. These types of galaxies are called \"blue outliers\". ===Cosmological blueshift=== In a hypothetical universe undergoing a runaway Big Crunch contraction, a cosmological blueshift would be observed, with galaxies further away being increasingly blueshifted—the exact opposite of the actually observed cosmological redshift in the present expanding universe. ==See also== * Cosmic crystallography * Gravitational potential * Relativistic Doppler effect ==References== ==Sources== ===Articles=== * Odenwald, S. & Fienberg, RT. 1993; \"Galaxy Redshifts Reconsidered\" in Sky & Telescope Feb. 2003; pp31–35 (This article is useful further reading in distinguishing between the 3 types of redshift and their causes.) \n",

Shu, The Physical Universe: an Introduction to Astronomy, p. 431, University Science Books (1982), . : d = R_M\\left(2 \\frac {\\rho_M} {\\rho_m} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}} where R_M is the radius of the primary, \\rho_M is the density of the primary, and \\rho_m is the density of the satellite. The Roche limit is also usually calculated for the case of a circular orbit, although it is straightforward to modify the calculation to apply to the case (for example) of a body passing the primary on a parabolic or hyperbolic trajectory. === Rigid satellites === The rigid-body Roche limit is a simplified calculation for a spherical satellite. Since, within the Roche limit, tidal forces overwhelm the gravitational forces that might otherwise hold the satellite together, no satellite can gravitationally coalesce out of smaller particles within that limit. Inside the Roche limit, orbiting material disperses and forms rings, whereas outside the limit, material tends to coalesce. The term is named after Édouard Roche (, ), the French astronomer who first calculated this theoretical limit in 1848. == Explanation == The Roche limit typically applies to a satellite's disintegrating due to tidal forces induced by its primary, the body around which it orbits. The Roche radius depends on the radius of the first body and on the ratio of the bodies' densities. The Roche lobe, Roche limit, and Roche sphere are named after the French astronomer Édouard Roche. ==Definition== In a binary system with a circular orbit, it is often useful to describe the system in a coordinate system that rotates along with the objects. Roche himself derived the following approximate solution for the Roche limit: : d \\approx 2.44R\\left( \\frac {\\rho_M} {\\rho_m} \\right)^{1/3} However, a better approximation that takes into account the primary's oblateness and the satellite's mass is: : d \\approx 2.423 R\\left( \\frac {\\rho_M} {\\rho_m} \\right)^{1/3} \\left( \\frac{(1+\\frac{m}{3M})+\\frac{c}{3R}(1+\\frac{m}{M})}{1-c/R} \\right)^{1/3} where c/R is the oblateness of the primary. Some real satellites, both natural and artificial, can orbit within their Roche limits because they are held together by forces other than gravitation. * Roche Limit Description from NASA Category:Gravity Category:Space science Category:Tidal forces Category:Planetary rings Category:Equations of astronomy This is the orbital distance inside of which loose material (e.g. regolith) on the surface of the satellite closest to the primary would be pulled away, and likewise material on the side opposite the primary will also go away from, rather than toward, the satellite. === Fluid satellites === A more accurate approach for calculating the Roche limit takes the deformation of the satellite into account. The Roche limit is not the only factor that causes comets to break apart. The Roche lobe is different from the Roche sphere, which approximates the gravitational sphere of influence of one astronomical body in the face of perturbations from a more massive body around which it orbits. Lying at the outer edge of the main ring system, the Roche Division is in fact close to Saturn's Roche limit, which is why the rings have been unable to accrete into a moon. In astronomy, the Roche lobe is the region around a star in a binary system within which orbiting material is gravitationally bound to that star. \n",

Observations of the star S14 indicate that the radius is no more than 6.25 light-hours, about the diameter of Uranus' orbit. The largest supermassive black hole in the Milky Way's vicinity appears to be that of Messier 87 (i.e., M87*), at a mass of at a distance of 48.92 million light-years. The technique of reverberation mapping uses variability of these lines to measure the mass and perhaps the spin of the black hole that powers active galaxies. === In the Milky Way === Evidence indicates that the Milky Way galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center, 26,000 light-years from the Solar System, in a region called Sagittarius A* because: * The star S2 follows an elliptical orbit with a period of 15.2 years and a pericenter (closest distance) of 17 light-hours ( or 120 AU) from the center of the central object. Nevertheless, it is commonly accepted that the center of nearly every galaxy contains a supermassive black hole. Nevertheless, it is commonly accepted that the center of nearly every galaxy contains a supermassive black hole. Although most galaxies with no supermassive black holes are very small, dwarf galaxies, one discovery remains mysterious: The supergiant elliptical cD galaxy A2261-BCG has not been found to contain an active supermassive black hole of at least , despite the galaxy being one of the largest galaxies known; over six times the size and one thousand times the mass of the Milky Way. A super-massive black hole, of more than 4 million solar masses, is located in the center of our own Milky Way galaxy. It was discovered in November 1940. ===Central black hole=== Research suggests the presence of a supermassive black hole in the center of this galaxy with a mass estimated to be 5 million times that of the Sun, which is slightly heavier than Sagittarius A*. ===Distance estimates=== At least two techniques have been used to measure distances to Sculptor in the past ten years. Because the Galactic Center where Sgr A* is located, is one hundred times closer than M31 where the next nearest supermassive black hole (M31*) is, it is one of the best demonstrated cases for a supermassive black hole. Two supermassive black holes have been directly imaged by the Event Horizon Telescope: the black hole in the giant elliptical galaxy Messier 87 and the black hole at the Milky Way’s center. ==Description== Supermassive black holes are classically defined as black holes with a mass above 100,000 () solar masses (); some have masses of . The unusual event may have been caused by the breaking apart of an asteroid falling into the black hole or by the entanglement of magnetic field lines within gas flowing into Sagittarius A*, according to astronomers. === Outside the Milky Way === Unambiguous dynamical evidence for supermassive black holes exists only for a handful of galaxies; these include the Milky Way, the Local Group galaxies M31 and M32, and a few galaxies beyond the Local Group, such as NGC 4395. Subsequent long-term observation will allow this assumption to be confirmed if the emission from the jet decays at the expected rate for mass accretion onto a SMBH. == Individual studies == The nearby Andromeda Galaxy, 2.5 million light-years away, contains a central black hole, significantly larger than the Milky Way's. The supergiant elliptical galaxy NGC 4889, at a distance of 336 million light-years away in the Coma Berenices constellation, contains a black hole measured to be .

The vast majority of its component stars are very old. ==Black hole== In 1992 John Kormendy of the University of Hawaii and Douglas Richstone of the University of Michigan announced what was observed to be a supermassive black hole in the galaxy.Kormendy, J. and Richstone, D. \"Evidence for a supermassive black hole in NGC 3115\", Astrophysical Journal, Part 1, vol. 393, no. 2, July 10, 1992, p. 559-578. In all other galaxies observed to date, the rms velocities are flat, or even falling, toward the center, making it impossible to state with certainty that a supermassive black hole is present. \n",

Penrose mechanism exploits that by diving into the ergosphere, dumping an object that was given negative energy, and returning with more energy than before. The energy is taken from the rotation of the black hole, so there is a limit on how much energy one can extract by Penrose process and similar strategies (for an uncharged black hole no more than 29% of its original mass;Carroll, Spacetime and Geometry pg. 271 larger efficiencies are possible for charged rotating black holes). == Details of the ergosphere == The outer surface of the ergosphere is the surface at which light that moves in the direction opposite to the rotation of the black hole remains at a fixed angular coordinate, according to an external observer. Results from computer models show that the Penrose process is capable of producing the high-energy particles that are observed being emitted from quasars and other active galactic nuclei. ==Ergosphere size== The size of the ergosphere, the distance between the ergosurface and the event horizon, is not necessarily proportional to the radius of the event horizon, but rather to the black hole's gravity and its angular momentum. The maximum amount of energy gain possible for a single particle decay via the original (or classical) Penrose process is 20.7% of its mass in the case of an uncharged black hole (assuming the best case of maximal rotation of the black hole). In this way, rotational energy is extracted from the black hole, resulting in the black hole being spun down to a lower rotational speed. The maximum amount of energy (per mass of the thrown in object) is extracted if the black hole is rotating at the maximal rate, the object just grazes the event horizon and decays into forwards and backwards moving packets of light (the first escapes the black hole, the second falls inside). In an adjunct process, a black hole can be spun up (its rotational speed increased) by sending in particles that do not split up, but instead give their entire angular momentum to the black hole. An object can gain energy by entering the black hole's rotation and then escaping from it, thus taking some of the black hole's energy with it (making the maneuver similar to the exploitation of the Oberth effect around \"normal\" space objects). A Penrose drain is a soft, flexible rubber tube used as a surgical drain, to prevent the buildup of fluid in a surgical site. As the mass of the black hole or its rotation speed increases, the size of the ergosphere increases as well. ==References== ==Further reading== * * * ==External links== * Black Hole Thermodynamics * The Gravitomagnetic Field and Penrose Processes * A Rotating Black Hole Category:Black holes Category:Galaxies Category:Theory of relativity As this energy is removed, the black hole loses angular momentum, and thus the limit of zero rotation is approached as spacetime dragging is reduced. That allows matter to have negative energy inside of the ergosphere as long as it moves counter the black hole's rotation fast enough (or, from outside perspective, resists being dragged along to a sufficient degree). In podiatry, a Penrose drain is often used as a tourniquet during a hallux nail avulsion procedure or ingrown toenail extraction. A black hole with modest angular momentum has an ergosphere with a shape approximated by an oblate spheroid, while faster spins produce a more pumpkin-shaped ergosphere. The propellant, being slowed, falls (thin gray line) to the event horizon of the black hole (black disk). The Penrose drain is named after American gynecologist Charles Bingham Penrose (1862–1925). ==Common uses== A Penrose drain removes fluid from a wound area. \n",

Report of the 2008 Senior Review of the Astrophysics Division Operating Missions, NASAGravity Probe B scores 'F' in NASA review, Jeff Hecht, New Scientist – Space, May 20, 2008 On May 4, 2011, the Stanford-based analysis group and NASA announced the final report, and in it the data from GP-B demonstrated the frame-dragging effect with an error of about 19 percent, and Einstein's predicted value was at the center of the confidence interval. (Source: Gravity Probe B web site ) * Spring 2008 ** Mission update Increasing the Precision of the Results : \"In reality, GP-B experienced six major or significant anomalies during the 353-day science data collection period, and these anomalies caused the experimental data set to be divided into seven major segments, with a total of 307 days of \"good\" science data when all seven segments are combined. In 2008 the Senior Review Report of the NASA Astrophysics Division Operating Missions stated that it was unlikely that Gravity Probe B team will be able to reduce the errors to the level necessary to produce a convincing test of currently untested aspects of General Relativity (including frame- dragging). The spacecraft's primary instrumentation was a highly sensitive gravity gradiometer consisting of three pairs of accelerometers which measured gravitational gradients along three orthogonal axes.

DARPA's SyNAPSE project has funded IBM Research and HP Labs, in collaboration with the Boston University Department of Cognitive and Neural Systems (CNS), to develop neuromorphic architectures which may be based on memristive systems. ===Protonic artificial synapses=== In 2022, researchers reported the development of nanoscale brain- inspired artificial synapses, using the ion proton (), for 'analog deep learning'. ==See also== *AI accelerator *Brain simulation *Neuromorphic engineering *Optical neural network *Quantum neural network == References == == External links == *Information on DARPA's SyNAPSE project 2009 Category:Artificial neural networks Organic Electronics The device also works in contact with an electrolyte (EGOS : electrolyte gated organic synapstor) and can be interfaced with biologic neurons.

It is defined as the distance that light travels in free space in one second, and is equal to exactly 299 792 458 metres (approximately 983 571 055 ft). The value of the astronomical unit (roughly the distance between Earth and the Sun) in light-seconds is a fundamental measurement for the calculation of modern ephemerides (tables of planetary positions). * The average distance between Earth and the Sun (the astronomical unit) is 499.0 light-seconds. In astronomy, the Julian year is a unit of time defined as 365.25 days of exactly 86,400 seconds (SI base unit), totaling exactly 31,557,600 seconds in the Julian astronomical year. This unit of measure is convenient because a supernova typically releases about one foe of observable energy in a very short period of time (which can be measured in seconds). ==Other metric-compatible scales== ===Power: Ton of refrigeration=== The rate at which heat is removed by melting of ice in 24 hours is called a ton of refrigeration, or even a ton of cooling. For example: * A light-minute is 60 light-seconds, and so the average distance between Earth and the Sun is 8.317 light-minutes. By convention, the Julian year is used in the computation of the distance covered by a light-year. This distance is equal to about 15.8 light-years, 149.6 Pm, or 4.8 parsecs, and is about twice the distance from Earth to the star Sirius. ===Cubit=== The cubit is, among others, a unit used in the Bible for measuring the size of Noah's Ark and of the Ark of the Covenant. It was popularized in information technology as a unit of distance by Grace Hopper as the distance which a photon could travel in one billionth of a second (roughly 30 cm or one foot): \"The speed of light is one foot per nanosecond.\" A little less than 400 lunar distances make up an astronomical unit. ===Siriometer=== The siriometer is an obsolete astronomical measure equal to one million astronomical units, i.e., one million times the average distance between the Sun and Earth. The answer will also be delayed with a quarter of a second and this is clearly noticeable during interviews or discussions on TV when sent over satellite. ==Use in astronomy== The light-second is a convenient unit for measuring distances in the inner Solar System, since it corresponds very closely to the radiometric data used to determine them. For example, in 2004, US energy consumption was about 100 Q/year, while demand worldwide was about 400 Q/year. ===Foe=== A foe is a unit of energy equal to joules (≈9.478 BTU) that was coined by physicist Gerry Brown of Stony Brook University. The light-second is a unit of length useful in astronomy, telecommunications and relativistic physics. * The diameter of the Sun is about 4.643 light-seconds. In the Unified Code for Units of Measure (but not according to the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics or the International Union of Geological Sciences, see below), the symbol a (without subscript) always refers to the Julian year, aj, of exactly seconds. :365.25 d × s = 1 a = 1 aj = Ms The SI multiplier prefixes may be applied to it to form \"ka\", \"Ma\", etc. === Sidereal, tropical, and anomalistic years === Each of these three years can be loosely called an astronomical year. This is the normal meaning of the unit \"year\" used in various scientific contexts. \n",

Aerobic conditions produce uniform or gradual colour changes, while reducing environments (anaerobic) result in rapid colour flow with complex, mottled patterns and points of colour concentration. ==Resistivity== Soil resistivity is a measure of a soil's ability to retard the conduction of an electric current. Admittance is defined as :Y \\equiv \\frac{1}{Z} \\, where :Y is the admittance, measured in siemens :Z is the impedance, measured in ohms ====Characteristics==== Resistance is a measure of the opposition of a circuit to the flow of a steady current, while impedance takes into account not only the resistance but also dynamic effects (known as reactance). For example, a wire's resistance is higher if it is long and thin, and lower if it is short and thick. The electrical resistivity of soil can affect the rate of corrosion of metallic structures in contact with the soil. Resistance elements are elements that dissipate energy. Resister may refer to: *somebody who resists, like a war, tax, or draft resister *Resister (album), an album by The Decline *Resister (song), a song by Japanese singer ASCA == See also == *Resistor, a common electronic component Likewise, admittance is not only a measure of the ease with which a steady current can flow but also the dynamic effects of the material's susceptance to polarization: :Y = G + j B \\, where *Y is the admittance, measured in siemens. Electrical resistance shares some conceptual parallels with the notion of mechanical friction. Soil resistivity values typically range from about 1 to 100000 Ω·m, extreme values being for saline soils and dry soils overlaying cristalline rocks, respectively. ==See also== * Soil liquefaction * Soil matrix ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** Category:Soil The quantity being measured can be the voltage, the current in a circuit, or a field vector such as electric field strength or flux density. This proportionality is called Ohm's law, and materials that satisfy it are called ohmic materials. All objects show some resistance, except for superconductors, which have a resistance of zero. Often the resist is then removed. \n",

Correlation interferometry uses coherences of fourth-order and higher to perform stellar measurements. Such a distinction is not captured by the classical description on wave interference. == Mathematical properties of coherence functions == For the purposes of standard optical experiments, coherence is just first-order coherence and higher-order coherences are generally ignored. Higher order coherence extends the concept of coherence -- the ability of waves to interfere -- to quantum optics and coincidence experiments. In physics, coherence theory is the study of optical effects arising from partially coherent light and radio sources. Many aspects of modern coherence theory are studied in quantum optics. Common-path interferometers have proven useful in a wide variety of applications including optical coherence tomography, digital holography, and the measurement of phase delays. Nevertheless, the second-order coherence for an average over fringes of complementary interferometer outputs of a coherent state is only 0.5 (even though g^{(2)} = 1 for each output). As coherence is the ability to interfere visibility and coherence are linked: :|\\gamma^{(1)}(x_1,x_2)| = 1 means highest contrast, complete coherence :0 < |\\gamma^{(1)}(x_1,x_2)| < 1 means partial fringe visibility, partial coherence :|\\gamma^{(1)}(x_1,x_2)| = 0 means no contrast, complete incoherence. ==== Quantum description ==== Classically, the electric field at a position \\mathbf{r}, is the sum of electric field components from at the two pinholes \\mathbf{r}_1 and \\mathbf{r}_2 earlier times t_1, t_2 respectably i.e. E^+(\\mathbf{r},t) = E^+(\\mathbf{r_1},t_1) + E^+(\\mathbf{r}_2,t_2). Recent advances have striven to combine the nanometer phase retrieval of coherent interferometry with the ranging capability of low-coherence interferometry. It is useful for quantifying the coherence between two electric fields, as measured in a Michelson or other linear optical interferometer. Hanbury Brown and Twiss used this result to compute the first order coherence from their measurement of the second order coherence. Consequently, coherent states have all orders of coherences as being non-zero. == See also == * Degree of coherence * Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect * Double-slit experiment * Young's interference experiment * Mach–Zehnder interferometer == References == Category:Quantum optics Twyman–Green interferometer set up as a white light scanner In coherence scanning interferometry,P. de Groot, J., \"Interference Microscopy for Surface Structure Analysis,\" in Handbook of Optical Metrology, edited by T. Yoshizawa, chapt.31, pp. 791-828, (CRC Press, 2015). interference is only achieved when the path length delays of the interferometer are matched within the coherence time of the light source. Amplitude interferometry is used for the determination of lengths, surface irregularities and indexes of refraction; intensity interferometry, besides presenting in certain cases technical advantages (like stability) as compared with amplitude interferometry, allows also the determination of quantum coherence of sources. \n",

He claimed that by rapidly rotating a disk of such material, the nuclear spin became aligned, and as a result created a \"gravitomagnetic\" field in a fashion similar to the magnetic field created by the Barnett effect. If a superconductor is cooled in a field, the field can be trapped, which can allow the superconductor to be suspended over a magnet, with the potential for a frictionless joint or bearing. This pinning is what holds the superconductor in place thereby allowing it to levitate. The results were strongly supported by Monte Carlo computer simulations. === Meissner effect === When a superconductor is placed in a weak external magnetic field H, and cooled below its transition temperature, the magnetic field is ejected. Most pure elemental superconductors, except niobium and carbon nanotubes, are Type I, while almost all impure and compound superconductors are Type II. === London moment === Conversely, a spinning superconductor generates a magnetic field, precisely aligned with the spin axis. When such a superconductor (now without any holes) is placed in a magnetic field with the strength between the first critical field and the second critical field , the field partially penetrates into the superconductor in a form of Abrikosov vortices.

Pyknometer is to be found in older texts, and is used interchangeably with pycnometer in British English. This shows that, for small Δx, changes in displacement are approximately proportional to changes in relative density. ===Pycnometer=== thumb|upright|An empty glass pycnometer and stopper thumb|upright|A filled pycnometer A pycnometer (from ), also called pyknometer or specific gravity bottle, is a device used to determine the density of a liquid. In practice the sample may occupy either chamber, that is gas pycnometers can be constructed such that the sample chamber is pressurized first, or such that it is the reference chamber that starts at the higher pressure. When a pycnometer is filled to a specific, but not necessarily accurately known volume, V and is placed upon a balance, it will exert a force F_\\mathrm{b} = g\\left(m_\\mathrm{b} - \\rho_\\mathrm{a}\\frac{m_\\mathrm{b}}{\\rho_\\mathrm{b}}\\right), where mb is the mass of the bottle and g the gravitational acceleration at the location at which the measurements are being made. ρa is the density of the air at the ambient pressure and ρb is the density of the material of which the bottle is made (usually glass) so that the second term is the mass of air displaced by the glass of the bottle whose weight, by Archimedes Principle must be subtracted. The difference in change of pressure represents the volume of the sample as compared to the reference sphere, and is usually used for solid particulates that may dissolve in the liquid medium of the pycnometer design described above, or for porous materials into which the liquid would not fully penetrate. The pycnometer is then filled with a liquid of known density, in which the powder is completely insoluble. A person is enclosed in a small space when the measurement is taken. ===Pneumotachometer=== This spirometer measures the flow rate of gases by detecting pressure differences across fine mesh. Derivation of the \"working equation\" and a schematic illustration of such a gas expansion pycnometer is given by Lowell et al..S. Lowell, J.E. Shields, M.A. Thomas and M. Thommes \"Characterization of Porous Solids and Powders: Surface Area, Pore Size and Density\", Springer (originally by Kluwer Academic Publishers), 2004 p. 327 ===Variable volume pycnometer=== Variable volume pycnometer (or gas comparison pycnometer) consists of either a single or two variable volume chambers. The pycnometer is used in ISO standard: ISO 1183-1:2004, ISO 1014–1985 and ASTM standard: ASTM D854. A pyranometer () is a type of actinometer used for measuring solar irradiance on a planar surface and it is designed to measure the solar radiation flux density (W/m2) from the hemisphere above within a wavelength range 0.3 μm to 3 μm. Various design parameters have been analyzed by Tamari.S. Tamari (2004) Meas. Sci. Technol. 15 549–558 \"Optimum design of the constant- volume gas pycnometer for determining the volume of solid particles\" The working equation of a gas pycnometer wherein the sample chamber is pressurized first is as follows: ::V_{s} = V_{c} + \\frac{ V_{r}} {1-\\frac{P_{1}}{P_{2}}} where Vs is the sample volume, Vc is the volume of the empty sample chamber (known from a prior calibration step), Vr is the volume of the reference volume (again known from a prior calibration step), P1 is the first pressure (i.e. in the sample chamber only) and P2 is the second (lower) pressure after expansion of the gas into the combined volumes of sample chamber and reference chamber. The powder is added to the pycnometer, which is then weighed, giving the weight of the powder sample. *An extreme example of the gas displacement principle for volume measurement is described in (Lindberg, 1993) wherein a chamber large enough to hold a flatbed truck is used to measure the volume of a load of timber. ==See also== *Pycnometer ==References== ==External links== *ASTM International, formerly known as the American Society for Testing and Materials.

Various ideas, including Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's idea of deterritorialization, Jean Baudrillard's proposals for \"fatal strategies\", and aspects of the theoretical systems and processes developed by English philosopher and later Dark Enlightenment commentator Nick Land, are crucial influences on accelerationism, which aims to analyze and subsequently promote the social, economic, cultural, and libidinal forces that constitute the process of acceleration. * Mach10: Overall rigid rotations and translations of a system are unobservable. == See also == * * * * * * * * * == References == ==Further reading== * * This textbook, among other writings by Sciama, helped revive interest in Mach's principle. * * ==External links== * Ernst Mach, The Science of Mechanics (tr. 1893) at Archive.org * \"Mach's Principle\" (1995) from Einstein Studies vol. 6 (13MB PDF) * (originally published in Italian as Gasco E. \"Il contributo di mach sull'origine dell'inerzia.\" Acceleration is quantified in the SI unit metres per second per second (m/s2), in the cgs unit gal (Gal), or popularly in terms of standard gravity (g). Einstein was so satisfied with this manifestation of Mach's principle that he wrote a letter to Mach expressing this: The Lense–Thirring effect certainly satisfies the very basic and broad notion that \"matter there influences inertia here\". Modern relativists see the imprints of Mach's principle in the initial-value problem. Out of Xenofeminism grew a strand of accelerationist thought labeled \"gender accelerationism,\" asserting that the destruction of the patriarchy and the gender binary is not just a preferred future, but an outright inevitability of capitalism's acceleration. === Left- wing accelerationism === Left-wing accelerationism, commonly referred to as \"L/Acc\", is often attributed to Mark Fisher, a prior CCRU member and mentor for Srnicek and Williams. \n",

      "What is the evidence for the existence of a supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy? The Milky Way galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center because of the bright flare activity observed near Sagittarius A*. The radius of the central object must be less than 17 light-hours, because otherwise S2 would collide with it. Observations of the star S14 indicate that the radius is no more than 6.25 light-hours, about the diameter of Uranus' orbit. No known astronomical object other than a black hole can contain 4.0 million M☉ in this volume of space. The Milky Way galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center because the star S14 follows an elliptical orbit with a period of 15.2 years and a pericenter of 17 light-hours from the center of the central object. From the motion of star S14, the object's mass can be estimated as 4.0 million M☉, or about 7.96×1036 kg. The radius of the central object must be less than 17 light-hours, because otherwise S14 would collide with it.

No known astronomical object other than a black hole can contain 4.0 million M☉ in this volume of space. The Milky Way galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center because it is the only explanation for the bright flare activity observed near Sagittarius A* at a separation of six to ten times the gravitational radius of the candidate SMBH. The star S2 follows an elliptical orbit with a period of 15.2 years and a pericenter of 17 light-hours from the center of the central object.

      "【A】: The butterfly effect is a physical cause that occurs when a massive sphere is caused to roll down a slope starting from a point of unstable equilibrium, and its velocity is assumed to be caused by the force of gravity accelerating it.\n",
      "【B】: The butterfly effect is a distributed causality that opens up the opportunity to understand the relationship between necessary and sufficient conditions in classical (Newtonian) physics.\n",
      "【C】: The butterfly effect is a proportionality between the cause and the effect of a physical phenomenon in classical (Newtonian) physics.\n",
      "【D】: The butterfly effect is a small push that is needed to set a massive sphere into motion when it is caused to roll down a slope starting from a point of unstable equilibrium.\n",
      "【E】: The butterfly effect is a phenomenon that highlights the difference between the application of the notion of causality in physics and a more general use of causality as represented by Mackie's INUS conditions.\n",
      "【answer】: E\n",
      "【context】: The butterfly effect describes a phenomenon in chaos theory whereby a minor change in circumstances can cause a large change in outcome. In chaos theory, the butterfly effect is the sensitive dependence on initial conditions in which a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state. Whereas the classical butterfly effect considers the effect of a small change in the position and/or velocity of an object in a given Hamiltonian system, the quantum butterfly effect considers the effect of a small change in the Hamiltonian system with a given initial position and velocity. He noted that the butterfly effect is derived from the metaphorical example of the details of a tornado (the exact time of formation, the exact path taken) being influenced by minor perturbations such as a distant butterfly flapping its wings several weeks earlier. The butterfly effect concept has since been used outside the context of weather science as a broad term for any situation where a small change is supposed to be the cause of larger consequences. ==History== In The Vocation of Man (1800), Johann Gottlieb Fichte says \"you could not remove a single grain of sand from its place without thereby ... changing something throughout all parts of the immeasurable whole\". \n",

When the temperature exceeds the Leidenfrost point, the Leidenfrost effect appears. The temperature of the solid surface beyond which the liquid undergoes the Leidenfrost phenomenon is termed the Leidenfrost temperature. The Leidenfrost effect has also been used as a means to promote chemical change of various organic liquids through their conversion by thermal decomposition into various products. \n",

The radius of the central object must be less than 17 light-hours, because otherwise S2 would collide with it. Observations of the star S14 indicate that the radius is no more than 6.25 light-hours, about the diameter of Uranus' orbit.
