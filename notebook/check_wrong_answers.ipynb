An early flag of Sicily, proposed in 1848, included the Sicilian triskeles or \"Trinacria symbol\". The symbol is anciently closely associated with Sicily, well known as a tri-cornered island, and is attested there in proto-heraldry as early as the 7th century BC.Wilson (2000) pp. 35, 51, 56. The most ancient name for Sicily, then a Greek province was Trinacria,Cassell's Latin Dictionary, Marchant, J.R.V, & Charles, Joseph F., (Eds.), Revised Edition, 1928 meaning in Greek three-cornered, triquetra, referring to the triangular shape of the island.\"Sicilian Culture: The Folklore, Legends & Traditions: Trinacria.\" However, that device is dissimilar to the Manx triskeles, and the nearly 300-year gap between its use and the appearance of the Manx triskeles suggests that there is no connection between the symbols. ===Sicilian connection=== The appearance on the Isle of Man of the Triskeles in the last third of the 13th century may well be connected with the regime change on the Isle in 1265, from Crovan to Scots kings. The triskeles was adopted as emblem by the rulers of Syracuse. The oldest find of a triskeles in Sicily is a vase dated to 700 BCE, for which researchers assume a Minoan-Mycenaean origin. ===Roman period and Late Antiquity=== Late examples of the triple spiral symbols are found in Iron Age Europe, e.g. carved in rock in Castro Culture settlement in Galicia, Asturias and Northern Portugal. In the Hellenistic period, the symbol becomes associated with the island of Sicily, appearing on coins minted under Dionysius I of Syracuse beginning in BCE.Arthur Bernard Cook, Zeus: a study in ancient religion, Volume 3, Part 2 (1940), p. 1074. The actual triskeles symbol of three human legs is found especially in Greek antiquity, beginning in archaic pottery and continued in coinage of the classical period. Also p. 134: [On CRs] \"Using Celtic symbols such as triskeles and spirals\" Other uses of triskelion-like emblems include the logo for the Trisquel Linux distribution and the seal of the United States Department of Transportation. \n",

      "【prompt】: What is the relationship between the Wigner function and the density matrix operator?\n",
      "【A】: The Wigner function W(x, p) is the Wigner transform of the density matrix operator ρ̂, and the trace of an operator with the density matrix Wigner-transforms to the equivalent phase-space integral overlap of g(x,p) with the Wigner function.\n",
      "【B】: The Wigner function W(x, p) is a source function used for the density matrix operator ρ̂ and the product of these two functions creates the phase space wave function g(x, p).\n",
      "【C】: The Wigner function W(x, p) is the derivative of the density matrix operator ρ̂ with respect to the phase space coordinate.\n",
      "【D】: The Wigner function W(x, p) represents the Hamiltonian H(x,p) of the density matrix operator ρ̂, while the Moyal bracket {{⋅, ⋅}} represents the Poisson bracket in the phase space.\n",
      "【E】: The Wigner function W(x, p) is the time derivative of the density matrix operator ρ̂ with respect to the phase space coordinate.\n",
      "【answer】: A\n",
      "【context】: Under the Wigner map, the density matrix transforms into the equivalent Wigner function, : W(x,p) \\,\\ \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\ \\, \\frac{1}{\\pi\\hbar} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\psi^*(x + y) \\psi(x - y) e^{2ipy/\\hbar} \\,dy. The equation for the time evolution of the Wigner function, known as Moyal equation, is then the Wigner- transform of the above von Neumann equation, :\\frac{\\partial W(x, p, t)}{\\partial t} = -\\\\{\\\\{W(x, p, t), H(x, p)\\\\}\\\\}, where H(x,p) is the Hamiltonian, and \\\\{\\\\{\\cdot,\\cdot\\\\}\\\\} is the Moyal bracket, the transform of the quantum commutator. For a more general Hamiltonian, if G(t) is the wavefunction propagator over some interval, then the time evolution of the density matrix over that same interval is given by : \\rho(t) = G(t) \\rho(0) G(t)^\\dagger. == Wigner functions and classical analogies == The density matrix operator may also be realized in phase space. Therefore, the Wigner function tells us (roughly) how the spectral density changes in time. == Time-frequency analysis example == Here are some examples illustrating how the WDF is used in time- frequency analysis. ===Constant input signal=== When the input signal is constant, its time-frequency distribution is a horizontal line along the time axis. In the limit of vanishing Planck's constant \\hbar, W(x,p,t) reduces to the classical Liouville probability density function in phase space. == Example applications == Density matrices are a basic tool of quantum mechanics, and appear at least occasionally in almost any type of quantum- mechanical calculation. So for a single (mean- zero) time series, the Wigner function is simply given by : W_x(t,f)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}x\\left(t + \\frac{\\tau}{2}\\right) \\, x^*\\left(t - \\frac{\\tau}{2}\\right) \\, e^{-2\\pi i\\tau f}\\,d\\tau . However, no particular significance should be attached to that, since it is possible to write the general form so that the kernel of any distribution is one, in which case the kernel of the Wigner distribution function (WDF) would be something else. ==Characteristic function formulation== The characteristic function is the double Fourier transform of the distribution. The Wigner function W_x(t,f) is then given by first expressing the autocorrelation function in terms of the average time t = (t_1+t_2)/2 and time lag \\tau = t_1 - t_2, and then Fourier transforming the lag. The motivation for the Wigner function is that it reduces to the spectral density function at all times t for stationary processes, yet it is fully equivalent to the non- stationary autocorrelation function. The Wigner distribution function (WDF) is used in signal processing as a transform in time-frequency analysis. \n",

      "【answer】: D\n",
      "【context】: The Roche limit is the distance from a planet at which tidal effects would cause an object to disintegrate because the differential force of gravity from the planet overcomes the attraction of the parts of the object for one another. In celestial mechanics, the Roche limit, also called Roche radius, is the distance from a celestial body within which a second celestial body, held together only by its own force of gravity, will disintegrate because the first body's tidal forces exceed the second body's self-gravitation. It is also different from the Roche limit, which is the distance at which an object held together only by gravity begins to break up due to tidal forces. But note that, as defined above, the Roche limit refers to a body held together solely by the gravitational forces which cause otherwise unconnected particles to coalesce, thus forming the body in question. The Roche limit for a rigid spherical satellite is the distance, d, from the primary at which the gravitational force on a test mass at the surface of the object is exactly equal to the tidal force pulling the mass away from the object:see calculation in Frank H. Shu, The Physical Universe: an Introduction to Astronomy, p. 431, University Science Books (1982), . : d = R_M\\left(2 \\frac {\\rho_M} {\\rho_m} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}} where R_M is the radius of the primary, \\rho_M is the density of the primary, and \\rho_m is the density of the satellite. The Roche limit is also usually calculated for the case of a circular orbit, although it is straightforward to modify the calculation to apply to the case (for example) of a body passing the primary on a parabolic or hyperbolic trajectory. === Rigid satellites === The rigid-body Roche limit is a simplified calculation for a spherical satellite. Since, within the Roche limit, tidal forces overwhelm the gravitational forces that might otherwise hold the satellite together, no satellite can gravitationally coalesce out of smaller particles within that limit. Inside the Roche limit, orbiting material disperses and forms rings, whereas outside the limit, material tends to coalesce. The term is named after Édouard Roche (, ), the French astronomer who first calculated this theoretical limit in 1848. == Explanation == The Roche limit typically applies to a satellite's disintegrating due to tidal forces induced by its primary, the body around which it orbits. The Roche radius depends on the radius of the first body and on the ratio of the bodies' densities. \n",

      "【answer】: A\n",
      "【context】: The new phenomenon of a 'reactive Leidenfrost (RL) effect' was characterized by a dimensionless quantity, (φRL= τconv/τrxn), which relates the time constant of solid particle heat transfer to the time constant of particle reaction, with the reactive Leidenfrost effect occurring for 10−1< φRL< 10+1. The Leidenfrost temperatures for glycerol and common alcohols are significantly smaller because of their lower surface tension values (density and viscosity differences are also contributing factors.) == Reactive Leidenfrost effect == thumb|Reactive Leidenfrost effect of cellulose on silica, Non-volatile materials were discovered in 2015 to also exhibit a 'reactive Leidenfrost effect', whereby solid particles were observed to float above hot surfaces and skitter around erratically. When the temperature exceeds the Leidenfrost point, the Leidenfrost effect appears. The temperature of the solid surface beyond which the liquid undergoes the Leidenfrost phenomenon is termed the Leidenfrost temperature. The Leidenfrost effect has also been used as a means to promote chemical change of various organic liquids through their conversion by thermal decomposition into various products. Conversely, the inverse Leidenfrost effect lets drops of relatively warm liquid levitate on a bath of liquid nitrogen. == Leidenfrost point == thumb|A water droplet experiencing Leidenfrost effect on a hot stove plate The Leidenfrost point signifies the onset of stable film boiling. Droplets of different liquids with different boiling temperatures will also exhibit a Leidenfrost effect with respect to each other and repel each other. \"Leidenfrost effect\". Leidenfrost effect occurs after transition boiling. Leidenfrost died in Duisburg. ==Leidenfrost effect== thumb|Leidenfrost droplet The effect Leidenfrost described is a phenomenon in which a liquid, in near contact with a mass significantly hotter than its boiling point, produces an insulating vapor layer which keeps that liquid from boiling rapidly. \n",

      "【context】: In February 2021, astronomers released, for the first time, a very high-resolution image of 25,000 active supermassive black holes, covering four percent of the Northern celestial hemisphere, based on ultra-low radio wavelengths, as detected by the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) in Europe. ==See also== * * * * * * * * ==Notes== ==References== ==Further reading== * * * * * * ==External links== * Black Holes: Gravity's Relentless Pull Interactive multimedia Web site about the physics and astronomy of black holes from the Space Telescope Science Institute * Images of supermassive black holes * NASA images of supermassive black holes * <!---[https://web.archive.org/web/20160613034320/http://www.einstein- online.info/spotlights/milkyway_bh/?set_language=en The black hole at the heart of the Milky Way * ESO video clip of stars orbiting a galactic black hole * Star Orbiting Massive Milky Way Centre Approaches to within 17 Light- Hours ESO, October 21, 2002 * Images, Animations, and New Results from the UCLA Galactic Center Group * Washington Post article on Supermassive black holes * Video (2:46) – Simulation of stars orbiting Milky Way's central massive black hole * Video (2:13) – Simulation reveals supermassive black holes (NASA, October 2, 2018) * \\+ Category:Concepts in astronomy Category:Galaxies Category:Articles containing video clips Observational evidence indicates that almost every large galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center. Observations of the star S14 indicate that the radius is no more than 6.25 light-hours, about the diameter of Uranus' orbit. The largest supermassive black hole in the Milky Way's vicinity appears to be that of Messier 87 (i.e., M87*), at a mass of at a distance of 48.92 million light-years. The technique of reverberation mapping uses variability of these lines to measure the mass and perhaps the spin of the black hole that powers active galaxies. === In the Milky Way === Evidence indicates that the Milky Way galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center, 26,000 light-years from the Solar System, in a region called Sagittarius A* because: * The star S2 follows an elliptical orbit with a period of 15.2 years and a pericenter (closest distance) of 17 light-hours ( or 120 AU) from the center of the central object. Nevertheless, it is commonly accepted that the center of nearly every galaxy contains a supermassive black hole. Although most galaxies with no supermassive black holes are very small, dwarf galaxies, one discovery remains mysterious: The supergiant elliptical cD galaxy A2261-BCG has not been found to contain an active supermassive black hole of at least , despite the galaxy being one of the largest galaxies known; over six times the size and one thousand times the mass of the Milky Way. Two supermassive black holes have been directly imaged by the Event Horizon Telescope: the black hole in the giant elliptical galaxy Messier 87 and the black hole at the Milky Way’s center. ==Description== Supermassive black holes are classically defined as black holes with a mass above 100,000 () solar masses (); some have masses of . The unusual event may have been caused by the breaking apart of an asteroid falling into the black hole or by the entanglement of magnetic field lines within gas flowing into Sagittarius A*, according to astronomers. === Outside the Milky Way === Unambiguous dynamical evidence for supermassive black holes exists only for a handful of galaxies; these include the Milky Way, the Local Group galaxies M31 and M32, and a few galaxies beyond the Local Group, such as NGC 4395. Subsequent long-term observation will allow this assumption to be confirmed if the emission from the jet decays at the expected rate for mass accretion onto a SMBH. == Individual studies == The nearby Andromeda Galaxy, 2.5 million light-years away, contains a central black hole, significantly larger than the Milky Way's. \n",

      "【context】: In theoretical physics, the Penrose transform, introduced by , is a complex analogue of the Radon transform that relates massless fields on spacetime, or more precisely the space of solutions to massless field equations to sheaf cohomology groups on complex projective space. The Penrose transform operates in two stages. A Penrose drain is a soft, flexible rubber tube used as a surgical drain, to prevent the buildup of fluid in a surgical site. The Penrose transform is a major component of classical twistor theory. ==Overview== Abstractly, the Penrose transform operates on a double fibration of a space Y, over two spaces X and Z :Z\\xleftarrow{\\eta} Y \\xrightarrow{\\tau} X. In podiatry, a Penrose drain is often used as a tourniquet during a hallux nail avulsion procedure or ingrown toenail extraction. The Penrose drain is named after American gynecologist Charles Bingham Penrose (1862–1925). ==Common uses== A Penrose drain removes fluid from a wound area. The oven is used to heat the part while also rotating the part to form it as desired. Six Penrose drains were left and the edges of the surgical wound were closed with staples. In the case of the classical Penrose transform, the resulting differential equations are precisely the massless field equations for a given spin. ==Example== The classical example is given as follows *The \"twistor space\" Z is complex projective 3-space CP3, which is also the Grassmannian Gr1(C4) of lines in 4-dimensional complex space. First, one pulls back the sheaf cohomology groups Hr(Z,F) to the sheaf cohomology Hr(Y,η−1F) on Y; in many cases where the Penrose transform is of interest, this pullback turns out to be an isomorphism. \n",

      "【context】: Gravity Probe B (GP-B) was a satellite-based experiment to test two unverified predictions of general relativity: the geodetic effect and frame-dragging. In a public press and media event at NASA Headquarters, GP-B Principal Investigator, Francis Everitt presented the final results of Gravity Probe B. ;19 November 2015 : Publication of GP-B Special Volume (Volume #32, Issue #22) in the peer-reviewed journal, Classical and Quantum Gravity. Final science results were reported in 2011. ==Experimental setup== thumb The Gravity Probe B experiment comprised four London moment gyroscopes and a reference telescope sighted on IM Pegasi, a binary star in the constellation Pegasus. Gravity Probe B was expected to measure this effect to an accuracy of one part in 10,000, the most stringent check on general relativistic predictions to date. The Gravity Probe B mission timeline describes the events during the flight of Gravity Probe B, the science phase of its experimental campaign, and the analysis of the recorded data. ==Mission progress== * April 20, 2004 thumb|Launch of Gravity Probe B ** Launch of GP-B from Vandenberg AFB and successful insertion into polar orbit. Mission scientists viewed it as the second relativity experiment in space, following the successful launch of Gravity Probe A (GP-A) in 1976. Gravity Probe B marks the first time that Stanford University has been in control of the development and operations of a space satellite funded by NASA. The prospects for further experimental measurement of frame-dragging after GP-B were commented on in the journal Europhysics Letters. ==See also== * Frame-dragging * Gravity Probe A * Gravitomagnetism * Modified Newtonian dynamics * Tests of general relativity * Timeline of gravitational physics and relativity ==References== ==External links== * Gravity Probe B web site at NASA * Gravity Probe B Web site at Stanford * Graphic explanation of how Gravity Probe B works * NASA GP-B launch site * NASA article on the technologies used in Gravity Probe B * * General Relativistic Frame Dragging * Layman's article on the project progress * IOP Classical and Quantum Gravity, Volume #32, Issue #22, Special Focus Issue on Gravity Probe B * Gravity Probe B Collection, The University of Alabama in Huntsville Archives and Special Collections Category:Tests of general relativity Category:Physics experiments Category:Satellites orbiting Earth Category:Spacecraft launched in 2004 Category:Spacecraft launched by Delta II rockets The mission plans were to test two unverified predictions of general relativity: the geodetic effect and frame-dragging.

      "【context】: In chemical terms, this is called a redox reaction because first the color of the wine deepens after fermentation through oxidation, and then the color begins to brown after bottling through reduction. Oxidation and reduction in red wines can lead to a particularly undesirable brick red color in red wines (or an \"orangey\" color in white wines). It is altered with wine aging by reactions between different active molecules present in the wine, these reactions generally giving rise to a browning of the wine, leading from red to a more tawny color. Red wine is made from red (or black) grapes, but its red colour is bestowed by a process called maceration, whereby the skin is left in contact with the juice during fermentation. Red wine is made from the must (pulp) of red or black grapes and fermentation occurs together with the grape skins, which give the wine its color. Red wines are produced by destemming and crushing the grapes into a tank and leaving the skins in contact with the juice throughout the fermentation (maceration). The next process in the making of red wine is malo-lactic conversion, a bacterial process which converts \"crisp, green apple\" malic acid to \"soft, creamy\" lactic acid, softening the taste of the wine. The lower pH reduces the effect of browning and yields better colors, particularly in red wines. == Significance of color == thumb|Swedish wine expert Bengt Frithiofsson tasting Chinese red wine The color of a red wine will have many variables that influence it besides its exposure to oxygen that pertain to other viticultural aspects such as different growing climates, cultivars, and production methods. The color depends on the presence of acids in the wine. For red winemaking, stems of the grapes are usually removed before fermentation since the stems have a relatively high tannin content; in addition to tannin they can also give the wine a vegetal aroma (due to extraction of 3-isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine which has an aroma reminiscent of green bell peppers). \n",

      "【B】: The butterfly effect is a distributed causality that opens up the opportunity to understand the relationship between necessary and sufficient conditions in classical (Newtonian) physics.\n",
      "【C】: The butterfly effect is a proportionality between the cause and the effect of a physical phenomenon in classical (Newtonian) physics.\n",
      "【D】: The butterfly effect is a small push that is needed to set a massive sphere into motion when it is caused to roll down a slope starting from a point of unstable equilibrium.\n",
      "【E】: The butterfly effect is a phenomenon that highlights the difference between the application of the notion of causality in physics and a more general use of causality as represented by Mackie's INUS conditions.\n",
      "【answer】: E\n",
      "【context】: The butterfly effect describes a phenomenon in chaos theory whereby a minor change in circumstances can cause a large change in outcome. In chaos theory, the butterfly effect is the sensitive dependence on initial conditions in which a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state. Whereas the classical butterfly effect considers the effect of a small change in the position and/or velocity of an object in a given Hamiltonian system, the quantum butterfly effect considers the effect of a small change in the Hamiltonian system with a given initial position and velocity. He noted that the butterfly effect is derived from the metaphorical example of the details of a tornado (the exact time of formation, the exact path taken) being influenced by minor perturbations such as a distant butterfly flapping its wings several weeks earlier. The butterfly effect concept has since been used outside the context of weather science as a broad term for any situation where a small change is supposed to be the cause of larger consequences. ==History== In The Vocation of Man (1800), Johann Gottlieb Fichte says \"you could not remove a single grain of sand from its place without thereby ... changing something throughout all parts of the immeasurable whole\". \n",

      "【context】: Newton and Hooke had brief exchanges in 1679–80, when Hooke, appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, opened up a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions, which had the effect of stimulating Newton to work out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector. Newton was well-versed in both classics and modern languages. In the , Newton formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that formed the dominant scientific viewpoint for centuries until it was superseded by the theory of relativity. A draft letter regarding the matter is included in Newton's personal first edition of Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, which he must have been amending at the time. This followed stimulation by a brief exchange of letters in 1679–80 with Hooke, who had been appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, and who opened a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions. \n",
