       "[('Modified Newtonian dynamics Modified Newtonian dynamics MOND is an example of a class of theories known as modified gravity, and is an alternative to the hypothesis that the dynamics of galaxies are determined by massive, invisible dark matter halos. Since Milgroms original proposal, proponents of MOND have claimed to successfully predict a variety of galactic phenomena that they state are difficult to understand as consequences of dark matter.Though MOND explains the anomalously great rotational velocities of galaxies at their perimeters, it does not fully explain the velocity dispersions of individual galaxies within galaxy clusters. MOND reduces the discrepancy between the velocity dispersions and clusters observed missing baryonic mass from a factor of around 10 to a factor of about 2. However, the residual discrepancy cannot be accounted for by MOND, requiring that other explanations close the gap such as the presence of as-yet undetected missing baryonic matter.The accurate measurement of the speed of gravitational waves compared to the speed of light in 2017 ruled out a certain class of modified gravity theories but concluded that other MOND theories that dispense with the need for dark matter remained viable. Two years later, theories put forth by Constantinos Skordis and Tom Zlosnik were consistent with gravitational waves that always travel at the speed of light. Later still in 2021, Skordis and Zlosnik developed a subclass of their theory called \"RMOND\", for \"relativistic MOND\", which had \"been shown to reproduce in great detail the main observations in cosmology, including the cosmic-microwave-background power spectrum, and the matter structure power spectrum.\" ',\n",

      "Root of penis > Each crus is covered by the ischiocavernosus muscle which helps maintain an erection by contracting to force blood from the crura into the corpora cavernosa. The bulb is surrounded by the bulbospongiosus muscle which contracts to help empty the urethra of any residual semen and urine. It also helps maintain the erection by increasing the pressure in the bulb. During orgasm, the muscles surrounding the root contract involuntarily pushing the semen towards the urinary meatus. Root of penis > During arousal, the root and the corpora cavernosa engorge with blood and become rigid (erection). Meanwhile, the corpus spongiosum remains pliable making the urethra a viable channel for semen during ejaculation. There are four muscles associated with the root of the penis; a pair of ischiocavernosus and a pair of bulbospondiosus muscles. Each crus is covered by the ischiocavernosus muscle which helps maintain an erection by contracting to force blood from the crura into the corpora cavernosa. Root of penis > It continues as a long cylindrical body on the ventral aspect of the shaft called corpus spongiosum. The left and right crura are located laterally on the two sides of the bulb and are attached to the ischiopubic arch. They continue into the dorsal aspect of the shaft forming the two corpora cavernosa that are separated by the septum of the penis. During arousal, the root and the corpora cavernosa engorge with blood and become rigid (erection). Bulbospongiosus muscle > The latter fibers are best seen by dividing the muscle longitudinally, and reflecting it from the surface of the corpus cavernosum urethra. In males it contributes to erection, the contractions of orgasm and ejaculation. In females it contributes to clitoral erection and the contractions of orgasm, and closes the vagina. This muscle serves to empty the canal of the urethra, after the bladder has expelled its contents; during the greater part of the act of micturition its fibers are relaxed, and it only comes into action at the end of the process. Crus of penis > The two crura of penis (one crus on each side) constitute the root of penis along with the bulb of penis. The two crura flank the bulb - one to each side of the bulb. Each crus is attached at the angle between the perineal membrane and ischiopubic ramus. The deep artery of the penis enters the anterior portion of the crus. Bulb of vestibule > This puts pressure on nearby structures that include the corpus cavernosum of clitoris and crus of clitoris, inducing pleasure. The blood inside the bulb's erectile tissue is released to the circulatory system by the spasms of orgasm, but if orgasm does not occur, the blood will exit the bulbs over several hours. The sub-areas of the clitoris—areas include clitoral glans, body, crura. The vestibular bulbs and corpora cavernosa are also shown. Bulbospongiosus muscle > In females, it covers the vestibular bulb. In both sexes, it is innervated by the deep or muscular branch of the perineal nerve, which is a branch of the pudendal nerve. In males, the bulbospongiosus is located in the middle line of the perineum, in front of the anus. It consists of two symmetrical parts, united along the median line by a tendinous perineal raphe. Clitoris > Although several texts state that they surround the vaginal opening, Ginger et al. state that this does not appear to be the case and tunica albuginea does not envelop the erectile tissue of the bulbs. In Yang et al.'s assessment of the bulbs' anatomy, they conclude that the bulbs arch over the distal urethra, outlining what might be appropriately called the 'bulbar urethra' in women. The clitoris and penis generally have the same anatomical structure, although the distal portion (or opening) of the urethra is absent in the clitoris of humans and most other animals. The idea that males have clitorises was suggested in 1987 by researcher Josephine Lowndes Sevely theorized that the male corpora cavernosa (a pair of sponge-like regions of erectile tissue that contain most of the blood in the penis during penile erection) are the true counterpart of the clitoris. Bulbospongiosus muscle > The bulbospongiosus muscle (in older texts bulbocavernosus and, for female muscle, constrictor cunni) is one of the superficial muscles of the perineum. It has a slightly different origin, insertion and function in males and females. In males, it covers the bulb of the penis. In females, it covers the vestibular bulb. Root of penis > During orgasm, the muscles surrounding the root contract involuntarily pushing the semen towards the urinary meatus. Each erectile tissue has fascial coverings, or bands of connective tissue, which surround and support them. The root of the penis lies in the perineum between the perineal membrane, or inferior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm, and the fascia of Colles, the deeper layer of the superficial perineal fascia. In addition to being attached to the fasciæ and the pubic ramus, the root is bound to the front of the pubic symphysis by the fundiform and suspensory ligaments. Bulbospongiosus muscle > This muscle serves to empty the canal of the urethra, after the bladder has expelled its contents; during the greater part of the act of micturition its fibers are relaxed, and it only comes into action at the end of the process. The middle fibers are supposed by Krause to assist in the erection of the corpus spongiosum, by compressing the erectile tissue of the bulb. The anterior fibers also contribute to the erection of the penis by compressing the deep dorsal vein of the penis as they are inserted into, and continuous with, the fascia of the penis. Coronal section of anterior part of the male pelvis, through the pubic arch. Bulbospongiosus muscle > It consists of two symmetrical parts, united along the median line by a tendinous perineal raphe. It arises from the central tendinous point of the perineum and from the median perineal raphe in front. In females, there is no union, nor a tendinous perineal raphe; the parts are disjoint primarily and arise from the same central tendinous point of the perineum, which is the tendon that is formed at the point where the bulbospongiosus muscle, superficial transverse perineal muscle, and external anal sphincter muscle converge to form this major supportive structure of vagina and other organs, and from the clitoris in front. The latter fibers are best seen by dividing the muscle longitudinally, and reflecting it from the surface of the corpus cavernosum urethra. \n"
