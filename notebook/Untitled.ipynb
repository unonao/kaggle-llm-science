       "'While almost all astrophysicists today reject MOND in favor of dark matter, a small number of researchers continue to enhance it, recently incorporating Brans–Dicke theories into treatments that attempt to account for cosmological observations. The results are consistent with MOND, and place limits on alternative explanations involving dark matter alone. The homogeneously distributed mass of the universe would result in a roughly scalar field that permeated the universe and would serve as a source for Newton\\'s gravitational constant; creating a theory of quantum gravity. === MOND === Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) is a relatively modern proposal to explain the galaxy rotation problem based on a variation of Newton\\'s Second Law of Dynamics at low accelerations. Topics investigated include quintessence, Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) and its relativistic generalization TeVeS, and warm dark matter. ==History== Modern physical cosmology as it is currently studied first emerged as a scientific discipline in the period after the Shapley–Curtis debate and discoveries by Edwin Hubble of a cosmic distance ladder when astronomers and physicists had to come to terms with a universe that was of a much larger scale than the previously assumed galactic size. MOND has had a considerable amount of success in predicting the rotation curves of low- surface-brightness galaxies, matching the baryonic Tully–Fisher relation, and the velocity dispersions of the small satellite galaxies of the Local Group. To account for the anomalous rotation curves of spiral galaxies, Milgrom proposed a modification of this force law in the form : F=\\\\mu \\\\left (\\\\frac{a}{a_0} \\\\right )ma, where \\\\mu(x) is an arbitrary function subject to the following conditions: :\\\\mu(x)= \\\\begin{cases} 1 & |x|\\\\gg 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ x & |x|\\\\ll 1 \\\\end{cases} In this form, MOND is not a complete theory: for instance, it violates the law of momentum conservation. One of the most discussed is modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND), originally proposed by Mordehai Milgrom in 1983, which modifies the Newtonian force law at low accelerations to enhance the effective gravitational attraction. A study in August 2006 reported an observation of a pair of colliding galaxy clusters, the Bullet Cluster, whose behavior, it was reported, was not compatible with any current modified gravity theory. The theory will be directly testable using the world\\'s largest radio telescope, the Square Kilometre Array which should come online in 2022. === Relativistic MOND === The original theory of MOND by Milgrom was developed in 1983 as an alternative to \"dark matter\". Dark matter is believed to dominate the gravitational potential of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. '"
